# Research

I studied Computer Science in Bielefeld, Germany, and received my “Diplom Informatik” with distinction in 2006. My project was a typechecker for the compiler of the programming language [ADP](http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/adp/), which is suited for Dynamic Programming problems, a frequent type of problems in Bioinformatics. My talk at Strangeloop gives an introduction to this topic.

In 2011, I completed my PhD in Bioinformatics and Genome Research, working on RNA secondary structure comparison by means of forest alignment in Bielefeld.
Check out my thesis if you are curious about [comparing forests](https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/publication/2474238).
Until 2015, I was a [postdoctoral researcher](http://www.major.iric.ca/~schirmer/) at the Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer of Université de Montréal.

My research interests include RNA secondary structure analysis, alignment and folding; dynamic programming and efficient solution of Bioinformatics problems; languages and compiler construction.
