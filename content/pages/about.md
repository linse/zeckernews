I am linse and I love to make things. Feel free to leave a reply regarding any of my projects. To talk to me via jabber, just add linse@randale.org.

I did my PhD research on RNA Bioinformatics, and also went to Hackerschool in New York.

Now I build infrastructure software to help the community at Etsy. Together with Hannes Mehnert and Jens Ohlig I wrote a book on functional programming in JavaScript and curry cooking (Das Curry-Buch, O'Reilly Germany), which is currently being translated into English.
