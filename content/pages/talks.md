Over the course of a year I gave a lot of talks because I wanted to learn more about public speaking. One time I gave two different talks in two different countries in less than 24 hours. That was exhausting but also fun!

I gave all kinds of talks, about dynamic programming and optimization, about functional programming, about building a shell, about engineering culture, and about Etsy's infrastructure. If you want to speak more too, I recommend [techspeakdigest](https://twitter.com/techspeakdigest) and [WriteSpeakCode](http://www.writespeakcode.com/events/).
